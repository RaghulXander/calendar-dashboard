You have been given a Frontend Assignment Brief, where you will develop a React JS web application. This project should follow best practices and feature a modular structure to support multiple user roles, including super admin functions. A key feature of your application will be an innovative calendar, allowing users to switch views (monthly, daily, yearly), create events, and visualize activities. You will use a Dummy API for content and organize your SCSS code per component, with a global file for shared styles. Ensure proper maintenance of layout, components, routes, auth guard, and middleware.

This application will start with a single "Calendar" page. Your task is to focus solely on creating this calendar page.

The application will utilize local IndexedDB for API advantages, ensuring robust storage and offline access for user events. This calendar integration aims to provide a dynamic, user-friendly and versatile platform for event management.

Your responsibility is to develop a calendar in line with the provided design, focusing on functionality such as adding, selecting, and viewing events within the calendar. API integration isn`t required, as JSON storage in IndexedDB will handle data management.
